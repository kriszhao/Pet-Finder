A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

When he finally showed up again, he had a large terrible wound on his neck. He was in so much pain and had tears in his eyes.

She has greyish black fur with a white undercoat. I don't know how else to describe it. She looks dark grey but if you brush her fur up its all white underneath.. She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated.

Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him. Anyone who likes to find out more about Ninja may drop me messages on whatsapp at (Michelle)",7bda94ad0,10.0,4

With broken hind legs. Probably knocked by a vehicle. He was crying but no passer-by cared to rescue him. My friends from the neigbourhood and I decided to check him out after hearing his cry for a couple of days and noticed that he was an abandoned puppy with serious injuries. We quickly raised funds ourselves and sent him to the vet for operations. Now, he is as healthy and lively as any other puppy. Soon after he was healed, we put his up for adoption as my friend's parents strongly against her keeping ""Oreo"" as pet. Finally, a kind lady adopted ""Oreo"" but only for 2 weeks. She surrendered Oreo to us saying the dog is just not right for her and Oreo has lost because she was careless . Finally my friend get to found ""Oreo"" in some where. Now, we have to put Oreo up for adoption again. I really hope that a kind person with love and care for animals will adopt Oreo and give him a comfortable live. He has gone through many hardship. From being abandoned to severe injuries, then adopted to be abandoned again.

GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and ""massage"", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone.. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Gerbera ♥",d8715d47e,6.0,4

The last 18 NEED HOMES URGENTLY as the couple is no longer able to care for them. Due to some personal issues, and a new baby then need to move out. None of the local pet associations are willing to take them on so it is once again left up to concerned caring citizens to help out and lend a hand. THIS is an URGENT call for HELP! These cats need homes within the NEXT TWO WEEKS. Please invite ALL your friends to this event which shall be on going until all the cats are rehomed.

Some videos: Giant and his tennis ball- Giant playing with Snoopy- Giant being bullied- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Due to the overwhelming response from my last email (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at.",b912b1114,5.0,2

Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has ""rescued"" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.",86547ad6d,5.0,4

I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me.

I may be small in stature (only 6kgs!) but will readily bark to alert you to someone at the door! I love to be snuggled - belly rubs are the best! I'm good with other dogs and like playing with small to medium dogs. I have sensitive skin so I hope my human will feed me a good quality diet. I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens. I'd really like to spend many happy days cuddling on the couch with someone who will tickle my ears and kiss my little apple head - are you the one for me?"" Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to partially cover vaccination, deworming, heartworm test/prevention, tick + flea prevention and skin treatment. 4. If she is found to be intact (i.e. goes on heat), spay after her heat cycle ends. 5. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 6. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :)",43b277272,6.0,3

Kumina has recently being vaccinated and neutered, currently healthy & ready to be adopted. Tested negative for FeLV & FIV. Litter trained. She is a very calm & relaxed cat.

Very suitable for senior adopters or families who appreciate peace & quiet environment. Potential adopters will be screened to ensure Kumina will be in good hands. Prefers adopters who has experience dealing with cats & understands the full responsibility of having one.

I found him near death and with severe, chronic mange, ticks, ulcerated wounds, an ear abscess and severely malnourished. After a few weeks of patient, loving kindness and veterinary attention he is now a very healthy, lively dog with a gentle nature. Brim is a special dog with an unusually gentle nature. It appears Brim may have been abused before being thrown into the street. He is shy around strangers and becomes nervous with loud noises. He would NOT be suitable as a guard dog. His temperament is too soft but he will make a great family pet and so I'm looking for a genuinely loving person or family willing to give Brim a lot of love and freedom to run around. Ideally this would be in a quiet part of the country or in a home with a large garden. I have started training him. He's now house trained, sits and comes on command and will leave the room when told to do so. He is also leash trained and will walk to heel. As I am only visiting Malaysia I need to find Brim a suitable home as a matter of urgency. If interested please email or phone [no messages please].",1bd200942,5.0,4

When people go near him, he will run away too. There are many cars in that area, he can get knock down very easily. We managed to get him and send him to a dog shelter in Cheras. He is not aggressive at all, looks timid and insecure and did not make any noise (no barking).

Unfortunately for us, we are unable to provide him the attention that he deserves as we have full time jobs as well as 2 other dogs, a bird and 3 guinea pigs at home to care for! He is a pure pedigree English bulldog, has not been neutered and has been given full vacination as a puppy. Before he is given to his new home, we will give him another round of booster vacination if adviced by the doctor. He stays outside the house in our home at Damansara Heights as he likes running around exercising and due to that, he is not toilet-trained. He is however quite intelligent for a bulldog as he knows how to play throw and fetch and runs away when he knows he is going to get a scolding :) We love him tremendously, but unfortunately, we are not able to keep him. We hope we will be able to find a nice family for him (we would prefer if the family has no other dogs since Hugo can get over-friendly without knowing his size and strength. He also tends to get jealous easily). If there are anybody out there interested in adopting Hugo, please give me a call. We will also interview prospective adopters to see if Hugo is a suitable dog for them. If the need arises, we will also do house visits to see if the house will be a conducive for an active bulldog like Hugo. Please note that we love our dog very much, and therefore, no breeders will be entertained. Preferably KL families only as we want to check future adoptive families' homes to ensure that it is right for our dear Hugo. Thanks :)",5e390710c,5.0,2

Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang. Please email or text me why you want to adopt Shiro and introduce who you are.",281618ba5,26.0,3

He used to be my friend's pet, but later given to me because my friend moved oversea. He already stayed with me for about 5 months until now. He really is a smart and beautiful cat, but since I'm just a university student I cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and neuter. He is now in heat state and need to be neutered soon or mate with female cat, but I don't dare to mate him with stray cat. So that is why I choose to give him for adoption for free, as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the vet or just mate him with female cat that you might have. Plus I will also give along his cage, food bowl, and litter box, all for free. Here I tell you some about Mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him. - Very talkative, so you have to be ready to hear some noises from him - He is on heat, so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes - Spoiled cat, so make sure you give him lot of affection - Toilet trained, he really can pee in your toilet bowl if you allow him to - Super clean, he doesn't like dirty cat litter - Stubborn, he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed, which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you don't let him to do so. - Afraid of thunder and heavy rain, yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely meowing very loud to get your attention, he will be quiet when he is accompanied. - Might become aggressive to new cat, I guess this is because he is on heat, so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt. - Do not confine the cat in the cage although I give you the cage, because it will make him stress. But overall, he is very nice, cute and unique isn't he? He also love to cuddle :) Contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above. I really hope that you will become a nice new owner, and please BE A COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE OWNER for Mio. Thank you ;)",74088eee1,4.0,3

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a Golden Retriever or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 8-June-. This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 6 points, please read on:- (7) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (8) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (9) No reservations please. First come first served. (10) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. (11) All who are interested, please send an email to . If you need clarifications, please call  . Please leave me an SMS if you can't get me.",d73b2a4c6,22.0,2

I was reluctant to put them up for adoption as both are very manja with me. However, my neighbor has recently complained about them going over to his compound. I suspect he will do something untoward. I now have to cage both for long hours. Not exactly ideal for cats. I can't keep them indoors as there are already 5 cats living indoors, and they are quite unwelcoming of newcomers. Really need an adopter who stays around Seremban, familiar with cats and their requirements, and have secure front- or backyard. I am willing to sponsor their food for one year. Do call me at.

Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

I've missed you!” I often walk to the guardhouse looking for her and she would sprint towards me and keep licking my knee. Slowly, I've noticed I wasnt the only “chosen one” as she would literally do that to every passerby. 😒 Ms. Faithful is a little bit timid, but that doesn't change her love and friendliness towards people.

She was sleeping and was pretty weak as she got injured at her ear. I don't know how did she reach up there but my maid found her there. She was very scared of people and also fearful of the surrounding. We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough. The Rm is a temporary deposit and I will only return Rm back once you have proven me the spaying receipt for Snow White. Rm 50 is for adoption fees as I use it to help other strays also. If you would like, any amount of donation is appreciated. SPAYING is NECESSARY if you want to adopt Snow White. I will give you the contact of my vet and I will arrange the appointment if necessary. Adoption condition: 1) Tell me your experience on handling cat. 2) Love her unconditionally .3) If cannot take care of it anymore due to some reason, please return it back. But no such reason eg: She is already old. Hard to care for it. 4)Give updates whenever you have time.Anyone who is interested please do PM or email me a msg.

I am currently fostering at Selangor. - NO students. Priority for locals. (Unless you can convince me, if you are an international) - Prefer working adults to support food, health and etc expenses. -** Adopters are REQUIRED to update progress as often as possible especially during the first few months. You will also be given probation to see if she fits your personality. I will reduce asking to maybe twice a year if I feel both of you are adapting well till I stop asking permanently. -** Adopters will need to pick up this kitten. ( Location : Bandar Utama ) - Proactive adopters will be given priority. **** Please provide details about yourself such as name, age, status : working/studying, local/international, hometown, experiences with pet (if none, research and explain), your house type, family members, your reasons to adopt, your knowledge to care for kittens. ** Please note that you will be asked other relevant questions to see if you are eager enough to have her in your life. - Vaccination is required to prevent any disease or infection.

If you are serious about adopting a family member and you are willing to spend time, money and effort to take care of the kitten then by all means contact me."" .................................................................................................... ......................ABOUT KITTEN......................... - She was rescued by one of the owners of Happie n Jovie ( Centrepoint BU ). She was found wandering around at Taman Tun Market calling for food. - Estimated to be around 2 months old. - Although she is a stray kitten, she is VERY human friendly. She isn't afraid to approach any human. I think maybe because she was surrounded by humans at the market. - She was really skinny, had flu and tiny eye infection, had lil fleas, dirty and has a skin issue. Her skin was dry and fur were shedding. She was really quiet the first 2 days, doesn't play but wants to be around human all the time so you can imagine how much she suffered on the streets. - She will be dewormed later on after the skin issue is cleared. (Improving well as she has been visiting the vet and is under medication) - She plays well, eats well, and her stool and urine looks good too! Familiar with litter sand. She has a playful biting habit nowadays though. She loves to bite my slipper and the boxes and my legs and my arms and the bottle and everything she can get her tiny paws on. I think it is cuz of her growing teeth. - She LOVES to play with paper clamp. - She likes to sleep with company. She's always beside me either on the bed or on the chair beside where I sleep. She also sleeps where I work or watches me do my work. - She has the sweetest meow just like the sweet kitten she is. She replies when you talk or look at her. - She is trained to come with a whistle tone. - I'm trying my best to get her in the best shape she can be before the adoption. - Please feel free to ask any further questions on the kitten.

I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase!

That’s because when I was 3 months old, I fell into a drain and couldn’t get out. I was wet, dirty, miserable and scared. Then a kind lady came and hauled me out of the drain by the scruff of my neck, took me home and cleaned me up. She took me to the vet where I had to have a jab and some medication. I was saved from sure death! Now I’m neutred, have all my 3 vaccination jabs, am healthy and quite cute & pretty. I’m now about 6 months old, but it seems I won’t be a very big dog. My Mummy says I keep growing long rather than tall & big. It’s okay, I don’t mind being a smallish dog. It makes it easy for me to move around the place. Because I’ve been so lucky to be saved, I’m full of glee and energy. You should see me run – I’m fast! I love playing with soft toys. I can sit, roll, paw & shake, and fetch – well, most of the time, I can. I love car rides & bicycle rides. I used to sit in the bicycle basket, but now I’m getting too big for it! And I’m not a big eater, so I’m pretty low maintenance. Sadly my Mummy can’t keep me as she already has 4 other furkids. I wish I could stay with her but I can’t.

Must not cage or chain the dogs unecessarily for extended periods. 5. Must be fed good food and given water daily! (yes some people don't think this is important) 6. MUST be neutered at 6 months of age. A refundable deposit of RM per puppy will be collected for this. 7. MUST be given medical care by a vet if required. 8. There will be a home inspection before the puppies are released to you. 9. MUST allow us to visit the pups twice after adoption - we will not impose on you and your family unnecessarily, and send us picture/video updates from time to time. 10. MUST not dump the dogs when it is no longer convenient to care for them. Remember a dog is for life. If you are unable to commit to care for the dogs for their entire lifetime, please do NOT adopt. ******************** These two gorgeous pups were dumped behind my vet's clinic. They are super playful, loves cuddles and loves to eat too! The two of them are very attached to each other, and are best buddies, so that's why I named them Ron Weasley & Harry Potter because they're inseparable! We hope that you can find it in your hearts to give these two rascals a good and loving home!",42fc9a244,8.0,2

But before that please do consider the responsibilities of being an owner and decide only after serious consideration. There is no point in wanting these kitties out of impulse and then deciding to abandon or give them away later.

Together we can make this world a better place for all living things and help save lives. Interested parties please sent a message (via petfinder.my) / facebook private message / email and please share about yourself (eg Malaysian/expatriate?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets?

Any juvenile-type e-mails without providing the necessary details (ie tell us about yourself, your place and cat ownership experience) required will be not be replied. Please don't just provide a phone number because we won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines. All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship. The important thing is to look at them as a part of our loved ones and not just another animal. Where there is love, relationship and trust will grow.

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Molly (3yr, female, neutered mother of Zee) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Zee, he is 2yr, male, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another.

All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other.

Conditions for adopting Puma: *Adopter must be attentive *RESPONSIBLE. Adopter should be willing to bare the expenses of future health probs (not just give up one day and leave/abandon the dog elsewhere) *Adopter must be caring, loving & thoughtful of their pet/pets *Like all dogs, Puma needs exercise so daily walks or plays during the week would be strongly necessary *Adopter must groom Puma occasionally *Adopter must be willing to vaccinate,de-worm & neuter Puma accordingly. *Adopter should be active in FB for the adopter to post photo's or updates about Puma to see how Puma is doing. *I may visit Puma un-occasionally at the adopter's place from time to time. *Adopter should bare in mind that once they adopt a pet, their responsibilities are forever so think well.

The house has been demolished half way and all the brick and wire was left there. The female dog was very thin and her bone was visible, the puppies (aprox 2 -3 months old) looks healthy to me. I decided to feed them kibble daily. The mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the kibble on the ground and move away only then she will eat the kibble and she never came close to me. The next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more puppies is playing together with the rest of the 6 puppies that makes a total of 7 puppies. And the puppy was injured on her left leg, most probably she hurt herself while playing under the bricks and wire. Today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the vet. Dr Sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. It was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. Dr Sam have dewormed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. The minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stich up the wound so that it will recover more faster. But the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and parvo virus. Overall the puppy was in great health. The puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sibling. Temporary i will be fostering this puppy until it recover and hopefully there is someone is willing to adopt her, As i'm staying in an apartment and i'm having my own dog with me, i'm worry my neighbour will start to complain. There are 6 more puppies plus the mother dog waiting for adoption.",4715f897c,15.0,3

The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant.

I remember it was a rainy night and I found him crying for his mother by the side of a drain. Luckily I managed to capture him without any issue and send him to his new owner ""Sammie""; a foreigner studying here. At that point of time, Sammie said he will be here for another couple of few years and when he decides to go back, he will find a new home for Tyson. But I did not expect to hear from Sammie so soon about him leaving Malaysia permanently by . I made a mistake by letting a foreigner adopt Tyson but I know that Sammie treats Tyson well.

Yes all his stuff will be provided: -his favourite kibbles -his favourite wet food -his favourite treats -his towel, shampoo, conditioner, brush -his vitamins Anything he needs i will provide and i usually send him for full grooming once in 2 months or once a month depending on the weather.

Zorro is a sweet dainty little dog.. He can be quite shy with strangers but once he is used to u, he can be very hyper when he wants to play. Though he is 5 years old, he can still behave like an excited puppy. He loves jumping around and skipping..He loves to 'lepak' in a small space like under his cage or the washing machine or the couch. He is very alert when i call for him and he knows quite a number of commands like sit, down , stay , no , in etc but his signature trick is ""malu"" and that's when he'll cover his eyes with his paws.Since he is a smart fella, i believe there are still room for him to learn new things.. Whenever i take him for a walk i dont need a leash bcoz he wont stray far for me and it will always be him who wants to go back inside.

He immediately paid a desperate call to pet rescuer, animal rights activist, and Pawse for a Cause founder, Seema Subash, for urgent assistance. She along with a member from her team, rushed to the site and rescued the puppies. They were only about palm-size at the time. Three months later, the puppies are still being fostered by her. They've received the required medical attention and have even been vaccinated. Seema is unable to permanently adopted Nemo and Dory because she already has other dogs in her care, pets who need her undivided attention. The brown puppy is female, while the white one is male. If you're serious about adding to your family, we are looking to have them adopted as a pair. It is crucial that they aren't separated since they are reliant on each other for their personal well-being and socialisation needs.

The color is rather unique, where there are white, orange and cream colors. Oh yes, he likes to ""meow"" a lot. Small Black, the third born kitten. Look elegant and magnificent, probably because of its color. He is black and his hair is rather soft. His chest are white and also white-legged like wearing a socks. His eyes are always round as in ready for ""attacking"" mode. Orengy, second born kitten. A little careless and playful. His eyes were squinting. Long tail, orange tabby and white.

Now he's fully healed, but his head slightly tilted due to the fever. That's why he looks pretty cute with his shortcomings. Just like his brother, Teleng is black and white-legged.

The vet advised it could be self trauma or an accident that might have gotten her left eye, otherwise there is no sign of contagious bacteria or virus. She has been vaccinated, dewormed for the 1st round and given immune tabs to boost her immune as well. For the left eye, she was given a special kind of oilment to aid healing and also a maintenance to avoid any infection. She has been with me for about a month now. The eye doesn't bother her at all. She is a brave little survivor. She is healthier and more active than ever. I have another adult cat at home, and they just love to play and play.

We thought she was hit as she was so stiff and barely moved. Fast tracking to today.... She has been vaccinated, dewormed and spayed. She has a scar on her tail (indicating a rubberband mark). She is rather timid and has to be an indoor-only cat. She is very loving, prefer rubs rather than hugs so might not do so well with children picking her up. She is okay with other cats and doesnt mind dogs (*have to be introduced properly) (**cat-friendly dogs only).

I am keeping him at home the time for him to heal properly. He is born in that garage, from a mix-siamese mum. His siblings disappeared but he stayed along with his mum. He has a really gentle nature so the other cats are bullying him. It turns out that he is really shy but loves being pet. With dome time, he will definitely get used to a family home. He already learnt how to use the litter. I can’t keep him as I already adopted 3 strays from downstairs that I will bring with me when I will leave Malaysia. So I am trying to see if I can find him a good family. I will keep him until the 10th of April. If by then I haven’t found a family, I will release him where I caught him. I will only let him go to a family that is not caging cats. Knowing where he comes from, caging will only make him unhappy. No outdoors, at least at the beginning, would be recommended. I am not going to ask you to pay for the neutering and vaccine, as I am willing to do it for giving strays a better life. All I will ask you is to keep the vaccination process on every year and to provide him a healthy and happy life. A cat lives an average of 15years. Please consider that if you adopt him.

Alert and great watchdog with a loud deep bark. A good, obedient and easy dog to manage. He was found in Sg Buloh just after CNY . We believe he is an abandoned pet. He is bigboned, weighs 25 kgs with a longish snout and suspected to be cross with Saint Bernard. George is best as a single dog or with female dogs only. No tying up or caging.

She is a good, alert watch dog, does not simply bark except for times when stranger is near the house. Understand basic commands like 'sit down', 'come here ' and when to start eating her food, does not bite things or shoes Advantage of adopting adult dog vs puppy: - Adult dogs are mature and character shown, as not all dogs have the character to watch a house (welcoming to all strangers without being alert), however Jolly is an alert watch dog that does not give in to people she is not familiar with. A good watch dog only works well if is not tie up or cage up whole day. - Adult dogs do not chew/ destroy things, not hyperactive or run around as compare to puppies - Female dog does not pee all around the house. They have set boundary for 'pee & poo' area - Adult dogs are more loving, easy to command as compared to puppy, and at this age, they would sit near to you just to watch you doing your things (they love companionship) Me and my husband love her very much, she has kept us feeling safe every night and she is a good company. The reason for us to give her away is due to moving, as the place that we are moving to does not allow us to keep dogs.

I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ♥ Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ♥ I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ♥ I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ♥ Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it! I'm gentle when I play too (no claws) and my favorites are string-toys and anything bushy / crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, etc). ♥ Foster mummy has already taken me to the vet for my first full check-up. I was de-wormed and given a clean bill of health. Now I'm ready for that special / permanent family to share my life with! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Max-A-Million would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age. ◘ Max-A-Million would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

It was raining heavily and the little kitten was all wet and hungry. I waited for hours to see any sign of the mother cat but there is none. So I believe that the little kitten is abandoned by the mother cat. Anyway, I managed to catch the little kitten and currently he/she is in the cage. I am still unable to hold the little kitten as he/she is still afraid of human contact. So, I am unable to know the little kitten's gender yet. My hunch is that the little kitten is a female :) I am looking for any potential adopter who is willing and kind enough to adopt this little kitten. The potential adopter has to be very patience with this little kitten as he/she is afraid of human. I believe that with tender loving care and patience, the little kitten will turn out to be a wonderful companion for the potential adopter. So, if any of the genuine adopter who is willing and able to care for this little kitten, please give me a call . Thank you. 1/3/16 Its been a week since I rescued this kitten and I found out that she's really a female and so I named her ABBIE. She's still wary of strangers but she's comfortable with me to the extend that she allows me to carry her on my lap and clip her nails. I hope that as time progresses, she will be more open to her surroundings and other people. 4/3/16 I think the kitten is male now that I have seen a little 'hump' near his rear end. So I am changing his name from Abbie to Aggie. 😊 9/3/16 Aggie is doing very well and quite playful. Hope he will get a new family soon.",0d653b602,12.0,4

We're seeking a potential adopter for the Cream Scottish Fold, while we continue to try our luck to bring the other cat with us. However, if the potential new family could give both cats a wonderful home, we would like both of them to be adopted together. Both cats are very close. They're mother and daughter. Separation will cause some distress to them so we don't want to do that unless it's absolutely necessary. Note: The cat for adoption is 2 years old and is currently recovering from a skin condition. Ideally, she will be better by the time she gets rehomed.. but if she doesn't. The potential adopter must promise to continue treatment. (We will supply the medication) The photo was taken before she fell sick. Below is a video of how she looks like now. (She needs patience from the new family to help her get better if she's not by the time of adoption.) The other cat is 3 years old. Both cats are quite shy and it takes them awhile to get used to strangers. But once they are comfortable with you, they're very sweet cats. All potential adopters will be screened and must agree to keep these cats indoors at all times. (No cages) They are apartment cats and have never been outside their entire lives. They do not know how to hunt and is incapable of killing anything. They are litter trained and don't scratch furniture if they have their large scratching pole and toys, which will be provided by us as well. Location: KLCC area. If you are interested in adopting our cats, please send us an email with a brief introduction about yourself and your family. Where you live (The area) and let us know if you have any current pets. Do include your contact details in your enquiry. ENQUIRIES WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED. *There is a mandatory adoption fee. The money will be donated to PAWs or Metta Cats to help other cats and dogs in need. Some information about the breed: Scottish Folds are not lap cats. They will only come sit close to you or on you when they feel like it. They do however, like laying on their backs to have their belly rubbed. Short-haired Scottish Folds are relatively low maintenance. These cats usually have a bath once a month, and brushed every now and again. (They don't really need to be brushed, but they like it.. so we do it.) Note: The cream coloured SF has a double-fold.. so there are more cartilage in her ears. This means her ears will need regular cleaning. Preferably on a daily basis. If not, 3 times a week would suffice too. The grey cat is more low maintenance. We clean her ears once a month. She's got a single fold, and her ears have lifted.. so there's isn't much of a fold left. We hope that these cats will go to a good permanent home. We're very sad about giving them up. So do not write to us if you intend to adopt just because they are pure breds, they're cute or because your child wants one. Breeding is out of the question as they have been sterilised. These cats will be extremely shy during the transition phase of going to a new home. The new family must have patience with them. Like adopting a real child.. don't expect a cuddle from them or getting them to come to you for a stroke immediately when you take them home. They need time to adjust to a new environment.. which will take 1 to 4 weeks or even longer.. (It depends on how they come to trust you)",9a1715a97,1.0,2

Initially we had someone who adopted her but, soon discovered that the owner is not a suitable candidate to have her. As guardians to this puppy, my husband and i felt that Marley needs a better environment and family. We have a 4-year-old Golden Retriever of our own that we rescued 2 years ago. We follow and practice the techniques of Cesar Millan and we are looking for suitable owners who are familiar with dogs to adopt Marley. Bob Marley is a 6 months old puppy; very playful, intelligent, alert and is a good watch dog. She likes to jog along with the handler. After awhile of getting to know you, you can walk or jog with her without a leash. As an advice, do bring along a leash anyhow. Golden Retriever puppies are hyper but will mellow down as it gets older from age 1 to 2 onward. Still, all dogs have their unique personality which you will come to know in time. This breed needs a cool environment due to its coat. They do well with owners who have big compound and lots of shades. For owners who prefer their dogs living indoor with them, this breed is also suitable for it, provided she can go out 2 to 3 times a day to do her business on grassy land. If you are unsure of this breed, do Google and study about this breed. We love this dog and we sincerely hope to find the best owner for her. Grooming is moderate.",50f87522f,5.0,1

She was locked up and fostered in only a tiny toilet as her ""home"" for 4 months. This is where she ate/slept/poo/pee-ed. She lived with near zero outside world or human contact and this eventually took a toll on her confidence. ♥ Emmie was later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). The biggest damage of all was her broken spirit...she had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Emmie has been under proper foster care and all her medical problems have been resolved. She has proven herself to be a very curious and eager girl! She loves to be pet, asks for more, enjoys treats, play and her evening walks. She gets better the more time you spend with her! ♥ Emmie is friendly towards other dogs (only needs a few days to adjust). She is VERY alert and started barking at strangers within just one day of staying at her foster home. She will make a good watch-dog (not a guard dog). ♥ Emmie is a near hassle free girl to care for. :) She is independent, un-demanding, not hyper and never fussy about food. She also knows how to use the grass patch as her ""potty"", no messes. ♥ Emmie is looking for a loving new family who can give her the time, patience and love which she was deprived of as a puppy. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Emmie should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for very temporary needs). She is a freedom loving girl. Please drop me a call or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this darling a second chance. Thank you!",7390b70c5,7.0,3

I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Mr Stripey, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.

We had her neutered. as after a week of food she went straight on heat, and attracted some very devoted toms, one is still her closest friend. Perhaps we should have had her put down, as we knew we were only here for a few weeks - but she is such a wonderful, affectionate and intelligent creature, we simply couldnt. Please can someone give her a home - she is clean in the house, a joy to have around, a little vocal - her voice is still a bit strange, possibly some Siamese from somewhere - a little needy - with the most amazing huge aquamarine eyes.

[names are all temporary, for convenience] Curly [Male Ginger] Has a curly tail, cute white toe socks and a playful and curious personality.

Chinaman [Male Ginger] Has unique eyes, and a comparably calmer demeanor compared to Curly, Tiger and Tortoiseshell, but still plays very well with all siblings at playtime 3. Trinity [Female tricolour of white, orange, black] Very playful and energetic, she is the one to initiate play all the time and runs around the most compared to her sibs. Also very fastidious in her cleaning, as I see her clean herself longer than the others do. She has a soft, very prettily coloured coat and white stockings Big Eyes [Female gray tabby] She has a comparatively gentler temperament, and is more on the reserved side like Chinaman, and both like to sit and stare quietly at times, but when it's playtime she runs about with the rest. She has softer fur than the others, and may turn out to have medium rather than short length fur. Tiger [Female gray-brown tabby] The runt of the litter, she is lively, energetic and can be very vocal to compensate for her small size. She keeps up just fine with everyone, and has a rather unique shade of coating, a gray orange hue.

Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old.

I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation.

He was hiding from another mother cat who was being very aggressive because she was near her kittens. We think he might be looking for his mother and just went near this cat, hoping for someone to take care or sayang him. He was shivering, limping slightly and had an ear pierced with a metal wire that was already turning rusty. So kesian.. We took him to the vet, who removed the piercing because it was hurting him. Good news, only minor injuries which are now healing nicely. We also dewormed and de-flea him. He was wearing a pink tag with the name ""NUR MAISARAH"" written on it. We are looking for his owner, or someone to adopt him. Please contact us by 13 May or we'll have to send him to Paws :( Thank you!",d719027fd,9.0,2

To date I have not had any replies to my posters. Lately the mother cat does not come back as often as she should and I’m doing my best to “feed” them.

They don’t have much manners though. They can be verbally abusive if you are late to greet them or come without any treats for them. They have absolutely no respect for personal space of others. Always snooping into my bags and sometimes car to see what they can loot off with. But they are good problem solvers, if they see me looking really confused with biscuits in my hand (thinking in what order to give them out), they help me by snatching the whole pack and happily distributing that among themselves. But they wait for me every morning at the gate to greet me without fail and when I am leaving work they see me off. They follow my car for a short distance too. These caring boys never let me walk in the farm alone. I would love for them to be a part of some families. Location: Ulu Tiram, Johor. Text/Whatsapp",d2fae31e8,5.0,3

The car was about to reverse and run over her when we spotted her and ran to stop the car from moving. We took her home and fed her as she was malnourished when we found her at 1 month old. She seemed to be eating well and seemed very happy but then 2 days later we found out she had contracted the Parvo virus. Complicated by her malnourishment she was in dire need of medical attention and was hospitalized and put on drips for 5 days. After she was released from hospital she had gotten over the worst of the parvo but still very weak and needed special care. Even through all the pain she never failed to wag her tail and smile at us whenever we were with her. She was a real fighter! We fed her high quality kibble to make sure she would bulk up but the virus seemed to have restricted her growth. Now after 2 months of intensive care, good food and love, Lucy is now a healthy, happy, slender puppy who shows no signs of the struggle she had in her early life. She loves to play and snuggle with you on the floor and is still the same happy go lucky girl she always was, always ready to greet you with a smile and a tail wag.

Please help if you can offer a loving home for one or more of them, and can committed to loving and caring for them for life. They are probably 2-3 months old, I can't really tell, very friendly and playful, needless to say, extremely adorable. Their mother is owned by a security guard and is tethered to a little guard station in Bandar Seri Damansara area. She gave birth to 12 puppies and the security guard did his best to feed and take care of them, but only managed to get 5 adopted so far. Leaving 7 puppies with their mama, mostly unsupervised, by the side of a street. They have reached the age where they are getting more and more curious everyday and are starting to venture a little bit farther from their mama each day. Other than the obvious danger, outdoor is no place for these puppies to grow up (with the constant rain etc, they will also need to be dewormed, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered). We bought a 30 pound bag of good quality dog food for the guard to lighten his financial burden of having to feed these many puppies and to give the nursing mama some much needed nutrients, but it will not last long. A friend who lives nearby has promised to check on them and give them treats when he jogs/drives by. We have also left a few toys for them to hopefully keep them entertained and keep them away from the street and from wandering too far away. If you are in the area, or know anyone who is thinking of getting a pet, or have connections to rescue groups, please share the pictures of these puppies and help them find their permanent/foster homes. The security guard can be found at Jalan Damar SD15/3 guard house and can be reached at . Rescues are the best breed!

I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at. You may also email me. serious inquiries only please. a brief introduction of yourself and a description of your experience with dogs is appreciated.",6d43edbe9,20.0,3

He appeared to be someone's pet as he was clean and neat. We later found out that he was left behind with two other dogs when his owner moved out. Mikey is friendly to human however he is territorial and doesn't enjoy mixing with other dogs/cats. He is a good guard dog and extremely alert. Our preference is for an experienced dog owner without any dogs or pets to adopt Mikey so he can adjust in well. Bull is energetic and athletic thus regular exercise is required. If you are interested, here is our requirement : 1) Adopter must be a Malaysian or a PR. 2) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. 3) Neutering and vaccination has been done. We will be charging RM which is the total sum of his medical fee. 4) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 5) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 6) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive his progress update. 7) We would like to view the condition of your home before deciding. 8)During the initial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Mikey is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 9) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter. Mike cannot be transferred to third party without seeking our permission. If you're interested to adopt Mikey, leave your comments below or contact me. Provide us your details (particular, type of house and experience with dogs)..",3828225de,1.0,2

She is easy to look after and does not bark unnecessarily. She is toilet trained to do it on underpad indoor at the moment, as advised by the vet; we have to separate her from other dogs during her healing period.

Thank you to all who choose adoption instead of buying :) --------------------------------------------- Free adoption but vaccinations and neutering surgery for the puppies are a MUST. We will follow up with adopters for the vaccinations and help to schedule neutering surgery when the pups are old enough. **** IMPORTANT!! **** % of puppies make a lot of noises and cry a lot for the first few days or weeks when being adopted. Because they're being separated from their mother and siblings and also unfamiliar with the new environment. They are % exactly like a small little human babe - cry when they wanna pee and poo, when they feel hungry or because of insecure, and YES - for sure they will cry in midnight time. Adopter need to understand that and please only adopt when you're ready to spend time and energy in raising them up. For sure puppies are cute BUT at the same time they are not easy to take care of too. **** **** **** **** **** We named the mommy dog Moomoo. Yesterday midnight she was found sitting weakly at the roadside, heavy breathing, drooling, no appetite, having high fever, stiff muscle and couldn't stand or walk properly. We sent to vet clinic immediately and found that she suffered from deficiency of blood calcium after giving birth. Immediate treatment was given and her condition been stabilized today but she's still very weak. We went back to her colony and found 6 of her babies hiding under a car. Moomoo're not allowed to feed her babies anymore if not she will lack of calcium again. We took all 6 babies home and taking care of the mom and babies in different places now. We really need to find all the babies a forever home filled with love and care urgently. Please, ADOPT instead of buying. A home means a lot to them. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring dog out - Keep dog indoor all the time - Agree to bring pet for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat them like your own precious family members Please give a home to Moomoo's babies ♥",c2aeb6a1f,20.0,1

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy.

(story background) We found her, her siblings (all 6 of them) and her mummy under an abandoned car in front of a 99 speed mart in Bandar Sunway. Our family came over daily to feed the mummy dog as our initial plan was to wait till all of them are old enough to eat kibbles and put them up for adoption and neuter the mummy dog. However, very very unfortunately, 2 of her siblings fell into a longkang and drowned while one probably wondered abit too far out and got run over by a car. We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too! (if you are wondering why we don't just take her in as our own, its cause we already have a lot of dogs, we started out as fosters but ended up adopting many of our foster dogs and now we really cannot take in anymore and it would be unfair for them because we can't give them the attention and affection that they truly deserve!) Sorry for the long winded story, so here is Molek, waiting for a furrrever home. She's extremely bright! Playful, active, sweet and loving! She mixes well with other dogs (benefits of being around other foster dogs)! She's a great guard dog too!

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a Golden Retriever or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 8-June-. This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 6 points, please read on:- (7) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (8) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (9) No reservations please. First come first served. (10) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. (11) All who are interested, please send an email to . If you need clarifications, please call Sannice  or Ryan . Please leave me an SMS if you can't get me.",484915b4f,16.0,2

Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property?

Now we are moving abroad and out of our three dogs we can only take one with us. Therefore we are looking for a loving home for her. With her shiny black coat she looks quite impressive, but she is a gentle creature when it comes to people. We have always felt very safe with her around. Tinka has attended dog trainings and knows the basic commands. She loves to learn new things and show her skills, and if she gets a praise for it - even better! although she makes an excellent guard dog she spends a great deal of the day being lazy and just being happy to be around someone. Her ideal family takes her out on walks and makes her part of the family (one of her happy days was when she ""convinced"" me that she was allowed to watch TV on the couch with me). In return she will be very loyal and watch out for her family. She doesn't like cats and needs some time to get used to other dogs. She was fine with our other two dogs, and I never had a problem taking her to the vet or leaving her at the kennel when we went away, but there are a few dogs in our neighborhood that she does not approve of. We currently allow her to be inside the house as well as in the garden, so please don't keep her in a small cage or on a chain all day long. Staying alone during the day has never been a problem We really hope that there is someone out there who will take her in (maybe even together with Rosie) and give her the life she deserves",8b2be8807,5.0,1

She is a perfect candidate for a family guarding dog because she can protect the house and her territory as she can warn owners of nearby strangers approaching. She can be very friendly if approached gently. She is very active when going out and enjoys hikes and adventurous walks. Joos has been to hikes to waterfalls and top of mountains and she responds very well to adventure in the jungle. Because of her dominant behaviour and strong character only experienced adopters will be considered as she needs a strong leader that she can rely on. Only calm and assertive adopters are recommended. I can no longer keep Joos because I have too many dogs and I cannot continue to foster her.

As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising.

He was picked up at a local mamak restaurant, where he had been dumped by a family. When I took him in, Swagger was skinny, dull and just wanted to sleep all the time, but with lots of food and lots of love he has blossomed into a playful affectionate kitten! Swagger loves his tin-foil ball, his mouse toy and a little bit of gentle wrestling. He also really loves his food and bowl of milk. A curious and adventurous animal, he loves exploring the world around him, but in the evening when he's exhausted he also likes to sleep on laps. When he gets excited, his beautiful long tail fluffs up like a mini Christmas tree. He likes to be scratched under the chin, and especially loves to have someone rub his white furry tummy. A great purrer, Swagger is also an accomplished kisser of noses. Swagger is toilet trained, clean, a good eater and a pleasant, well-mannered kitten, suitable for children and adults.

He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy."" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - he weighs over g. On 20 Jan , he weighs g. On 24 Feb , he weighs 1.6kg. * Frontline anti-flea spray treatment was applied on 23 Feb . * Able to eat solid food - kibble, wet cat food and chicken. * Litter-box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets regular good fresh food. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure that he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

They have been dewormed and deticked, and are in excellent health. They are still very young and need a tremendous amount of care and affection. Note: 1 puppy was adopted in late July . GENUINE ADOPTERS ONLY - If you are thinking of adopting puppies, I urge you, do not think of adopting them based on ""beauty"" and ""cuteness"". Dogs will mature (obviously) so their ""cute puppy"" factor will soon be gone, but they can be your steadfast companions for a significant number of years. They will be a lot of work to look after, but they will give you a lot of affection and happiness in return. I humbly request a small adoption fee of RM50 per puppy as I had them dewormed and deticked at the vets, though this fee is not compulsory. Note: I do not know what breed these puppies are, nor how large they will grow to. I put ""medium-size"" based on the size of their mother.",e9e263ee2,4.0,4

That's why mummy decided to let me live with them. _______________________________________________ Faith was a little tiny puppy when I found her wandering around.She had a bald tip tail and hind legs and could not walk properly thus we believed she was ill-treated from home and had no proper nutrition. So we brought her home and sent her to the vet. The vet said she was about 1 month plus old then. She was given medicine and dewormed but not heart guard as she was too tiny. She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home. I am now not working but will soon be working again.

2,Mama Kin (Urgent!),12,266,0,2,1,6,7,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,0,41401,9960b6828055b5c43a439eefea4c805e,0,"Profile Ringkas: Name: Mama Kin Age: Adult cat.Probably 1 year and half. Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",b6fbfa344,12.0,2
